      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git
      ```
   - Navigate to the cloned directory and add your HTML, CSS, and other files.

3. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**
   - Add the files to the repository:
      ```bash
      git add .
      ```
    - Commit the changes:
      ```bash
      git commit -m "Initial commit"
      ```
    - Push the changes to GitHub:
      ```bash
      git push origin main
      ```

4. **Access Your GitHub Page:**
   - After a few minutes, your website will be live at `https://username.github.io`.
